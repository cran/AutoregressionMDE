Description: Consider autoregressive model of order p where the distribution function of innovation is unknown, but innovations are independent and symmetrically distributed. The package contains a function named ARMDE which takes X (vector of n observations) and p (order of the model) as input argument and returns minimum distance estimator of the parameters in the model.
